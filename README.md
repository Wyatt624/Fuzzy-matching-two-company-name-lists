# Fuzzy-matching-two-company-name-lists
Used Sparse Matrix Method for fuzzy matching two company name lists which is faster than Python Packages.

Copying a huge part of the code of below website, I changed the mechanism inside to handle two datasets matching problem, which was only used for one company name list in the code below.
